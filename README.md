Data: This dataset was created as a means to predict whether a person is likely to suffer from a stroke, based on a certain number of parameters. These parameters include categories such as gender, age, various diseases, and even data about the person’s smoking habits.
We came across this dataset on Kaggle, which is a crowd-sourced platform to attract data scientists so that they can share and publish data sets

Audience: This dataset can be used by most people, however, it’s intended audience would be those who are interested in looking at their likelihood of having a stroke. Specifically those who believe are experiencing symptoms or are worried about strokes and wish to know the probability of a stroke based on several external factors that are targeted in this app. To do so, the dataset looks at various factors such as age, other diseases, smoking, etc. to help people effectively understand and predict their chances of having a stroke.

Questions that we will answer in this app:

1. How age and gender play a role in increasing or decreasing the likeliness of a stroke?

2. Exploring the correlation between change in BMI and average glucose level in the possibility of having a stroke?

3. How does smoking influence the likeliness of suffering from a stroke?
